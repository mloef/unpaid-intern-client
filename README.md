# unpaid-intern-client

first time setup:

1. `pip install open-interpreter` ideally in a venv or some isolated environment. this env will get VERY messy due to GPT activity
2. `which python` and save this output. you MUST run this in the same python environment as the above; ie, if you run `interpreter`, it should work
3. somewhere in discord, type \@yourusername and hit enter. this should give you a long number. save it
4. get an openai key lol
5. start the app
6. Enter each of the above in the corresponding sections of the form and hit submit
7. The bot will dm you!

You can send `reset` via discord to reset the conversation.

If you want the bot to be reliable while you're afk, open terminal and run `caffeine` to keep your computer from sleeping.
